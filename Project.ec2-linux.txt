I learned how to create and edit files in Linux using text editors like nano and vi/vim.
 I used commands like touch to create files and chmod to manage file permissions(read, write and execute).
 I also practiced checking file permissions with ls -l and navigating the filesystem with pwd. This exercise is part of my bootcamp,
 where I'm developing hands-on skills in Linux system administration.
